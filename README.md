# NNPDE
Project on using Neural Network to solve ODEs/PDEs 
(part of the Erdos Data Science Bootcamp final Project - Fall 2021).


We are interested in the so-called *Physics informed Neural Network*, a simple machine learning technique where we can use to solve ODEs/PDEs numerically. In this project we modified the original method, where instead of computing gradients by back-propagation we evaluate gradients using finite difference scheme. We illustrate the results on multiple examples. 

Each example is a self-contained jupyter notebook that solves a different ODE and reports the results. You can see the results of running the programs in the .pdf presentation slides.
