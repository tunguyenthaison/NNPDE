# NNPDE
Project on using Neural Network to solve ODEs/PDEs (part of the Erdos Data Science Bootcamp final Project - Fall 2021).
We are interested in the so-called *Physics informed Neural Network*, a simple machine learning technique where we can use to solve ODEs/PDEs numerically. In this project we modified the original method, where instead of computing gradients by back-propagation we evaluate gradients using finite difference scheme. We illustrate the results on multiple examples.
